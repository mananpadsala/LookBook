**Attendance Management System with Face Detection using FaceNet and FastAPI**

This project presents an advanced Attendance Management System that leverages Face Detection technology, specifically the FaceNet one-shot algorithm, to automate the process of marking attendance based on group pictures. The system is built using FastAPI, a modern web framework for efficient development.

**Key Features:**
Face Detection: The system utilizes the powerful FaceNet one-shot algorithm to accurately detect and identify student faces in a group picture.
Automation: With the implemented solution, professors can effortlessly capture a group picture of students, and the system automatically marks the attendance of all present students by detecting their faces.
FastAPI Integration: The web application is built using FastAPI, which ensures high performance and a user-friendly interface for seamless attendance tracking.

**Benefits:**
Improved Efficiency: By automating attendance tracking, the system eliminates the need for manual attendance taking, saving time and effort for professors.
Accuracy and Reliability: Leveraging FaceNet's face recognition algorithm, the system ensures accurate identification of individual students, reducing the chances of false recognition.
Streamlined Process: The intuitive web interface simplifies the attendance management process, making it convenient and accessible for professors.

**Usage:**
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install the required dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file.
Launch the application by running the specified commands in the project documentation.
